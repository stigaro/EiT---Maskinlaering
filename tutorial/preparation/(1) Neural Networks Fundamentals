+   Four videos in a playlist. You must watch all of them and make sure you understand the general idea.
    The last video is probably too advanced, but do watch it with an open mind and try to understand the 'concept' :).

        (Ofcourse, if there are any questions you would like to ask, do not hesitate!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Key learning concepts and questions you must understand. Feel free to google if you are unsure.
(Deliberate on the keywords and answer all questions, we will talk about these in a group afterwards!):

    * Data
        - Q:    How can an image be used as input to a neural network?
                Hint -> How can a 2D shape be fed into the network?
        - Q:    How can a neural network learn to recognize the numbers.
        - Q:    We always separate data into 'training' and 'testing', why do we do this?

    * Feeding forward
        - Q:    What mathematical equation is used to calculate recursively forward from the inputs?
        - Q:    What is a weight in a neural network? What does it represent?
        - Q:    What is a bias and why is it used?
        - Q:    What is an Activation Function and why is it used?
        - Q:    What is the output of the network after after a feed-forward operation is done?

    * Gradient based Learning
        - Q:    How can training be done on the output of a neural network (Supervised)?
        - Q:    What is a loss function, and what is it used for?
        - Q:    What is a gradient/what does it represent?
        - Q:    What is the local minima vs. global minima problem in gradient learning?

    * Feeding backwards
        - Information:  In no way do you need to understand backward propogation in detail. Just make sure you understand the concept!

        - Q:    Where does a backwards operation of a neural network begin and end?
        - Q:    What do we adjust when doing a backwards pass?
        - Q:    What is the key matchematical concept used in the backwards pass?
