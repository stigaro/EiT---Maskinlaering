+   One video from MIT. You must watch the entire thing and make sure you understand the general idea.
    In general the concepts will probably be very different and hard to grasp at the first time.
    Just watch everything and try to understand, we can discuss in detail afterwards and get a general idea
    about how Convolutional Neural Networks work, and why they are useful.

        (Ofcourse, if there are any questions you would like to ask, do not hesitate!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

+   We will not do a direct questions list. The task you will have to do is to write a list of the main things that separate
    plain Neural Networks from Convolutional Neural Networks. We will discuss in a group afterwards and bring up the key differences we have found.

    Ask yourself these things for example;
        - What is different in how the feed forward operation works
        - Why is CNNs in general more efficient at image recognition tasks

            - Does not only dived pictures into chunks, but also uses filters 

        - ... (Find more yourself)

        - Has a spatial window sliding over the picture dividing it into
        overlapping chunks.
        - Using filters to detect variations of charecteristics.
        - Classify multiple objects at once
        - Specified for images
