Need to add "python -m" infront? <br>
python -m pip install torch==1.8.0+cu111 torchvision==0.9.0+cu111 torchaudio===0.8.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

Kaggle must also be pip installed so that the API can be accessed. This requires the user to have an API key downloaded and set up.
